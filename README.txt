A:
  In the first function:
    Pd(pointer double) Rd(referance double)
  In the second function:
    i(int) f(float)



B:
  output:
    1 8
    4 8
    4 8
    8 8
  reason:
    In each line
    the first number is the size of the different type(char,int,float,double)
    the second number is the size of pointer
    so the second numbers are the same
